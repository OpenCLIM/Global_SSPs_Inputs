  summary: >
    The first model in the workflow designed to crop global ssp datasets to a specific country.
    This model takes all of the user parameter and dataset inputs and formats them ready to be used by the subsequent models.
    This data is then propogated through the model, reducing user input. 
  source_code: https://github.com/OpenCLIM/Global_SSPs_Inputs/ 
  description: >
    All data/ choices made by the user are inputted at this stage of the model to reduce user error. 
    This process simplifies the user input methods.

          Countries are often divided into administration zones at regional, national and district levels. In most administration datasets, a numerical value is given to the level.
          This parameter is recorded in the metadata file so that all people looking at the data know which administration region was used.
